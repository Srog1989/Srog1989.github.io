Here I am at the end of mod 3, Christmas Day of 2020 and I've officially dipped my toes into rails!! Whew!!!  As if 2020 hasn't been crazy enough with Covid, an Election, and many other things,  our projects end up being due Christmas Day. Yikes!! Working on this and getting ready for the holiday with three littles at home has made for an intense December. With that being said, I truly can't believe how fas the last mod went by! 

As mentioned before, having three kids, I planned out my budget and gift list for each child prior to Christmas shopping which sparked the idea of creating an application called Christmas List. This project uses Ruby on Rails which is an MVC(Models, Views, Controllers) structured framework. Compared to Sinatra that I used for my last application, I was able to use rails generators to assist me in creating my files for my project and had it all set up in a jiffy! All was smooth sailing until it came time to handle my nested routes and build nested forms. I underestimated how complex this process was going to be, but once I got through it, it felt so rewarding.

In my application, I have three models. Users, Presents, and Recipients.  A user is able to create a present and recipeint object at the same time by using nested forms and routes. Getting the present object to create was one of my biggest obstacles. I was able to overcome this by changing my routes and actions in my controllers. After many struggles and hurdles I was able to overcome all obstacles and have completed my project and have a fully functioning Rails application. My user is able to signup, log in, log out and is able to create a new present or recipient object, and do full CRUD on each. 

There have been so many different things we've covered and let me tell you, my brain is feeling it! I feel extremely grateful this holiday season for being given the opportunity to take on this journey of coding, and to say i'm ready for mod 4 is an understatement! With all of that said, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!!
