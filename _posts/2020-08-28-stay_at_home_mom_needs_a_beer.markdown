Almost eight years ago I became a mom. I have three beautiful children, and let me telI you my mom bun and coffee tolerance is on point! Although those years have flown by, I truly can't believe how fast the last eight weeks have gone by. Between the Covid-19 pandemic, doing the PT  Online Software Engineering Program along with my husband who works twelve hours a day, doing online learning with a kindergartner and a second grader, while taking care of housework and a busy three year old on top of it, I think its fair to say, sometimes I like to enjoy a beer! Which lead me to create, you guessed it, a Brewery Locator CLI based my users choice of state.

Here we are at the end of Mod 1 in the program, and I can say that I have successfully created a functioning CLI gem that uses ruby methods to retrieve and print information for a user. I got my data by making an API call to a brewery data webiste. I learned very quickly in building my own project that binding.pry was going to be a very useful tool because it allows me to access what local variables, methods, "self", instance variables, etc. are equal to within my code. This was something that I was intimidated by and didnt use a lot prior to the project, and now I feel comfortable in using it. In my bin file is where I have my executable file titled breweries. This is where my program begins. That file triggers a greeting method in the lib/cli file which welcomes my user to the program. From there my program calls several methods used throughout my prorgram to put out the information my user will need. My user selects a numbner from a list of states that they would like to see a list of breweries for. My program shows them a list of breweries by name based on the state selection they made , then asks them if they'd like to return to the main menu or exit. 

Learning how to create my files and getting them to communicate was a major challenge for me, but it feels so rewarding to get it done. Eight weeks ago, I had no idea what a method was and here I am, writing functioning code! This is a huge accomplishment for me and as a woman that has dedicated most of her adult life to raising babies, this journey so far has made me feel empowered and proud to show my kids what mommy is capable of! I guess they are right, I am kind of like a superhero! I look forward to seeing what knowledge and challenges the next modules brings me!

With that being said, cheers to you my fellow coders who are finishing mod 1!üçª
